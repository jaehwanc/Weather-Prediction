# Weather-Prediction

This project is basically we will predict weather there is rainfall at a location using a data set based on (processed) infrared satellite image information. There are 200,000 observation / sample points with 14 features.
Training data: 126,551 samples of class 0 (no rain) and 73,449 samples of class 1 (rain)

Learners we used in this project
a.	Logistic Regression
b.	K-Nearest Neighbors
c.	Random Forest
d.	Neural Network

We divided the data set in X_train.txt into two parts - training data set and validation data set- with ratio 80% and 20% respectively so that we can train our data and test the model on validation data set before actually testing on the real test data set, X_test.txt at Kaggle.
We donâ€™t have test data of Y, so we used error rate(misclassification) of training, validation, Kaggle test, and our goal is to get highest accuracy on Kaggle test data set.
